Here are the programs and their outputs related to the following questions:
1) 🏆write a program to display the image matrix
2) 🥽write a program to display an Image Histogram 
3) 💐write a program to find Histogram equalization and display that image📱
4) 🎂write a program to smooth the image using a Gaussian filter and display the image💐
5) 📱write a program to find 1st order derivative and display the image and first-order derivative🥽
6)✈ write a program to find second order derivative and display the image and second-order derivative🍫
7)🍫 write program to determine the edges using connected set V. Draw a line to draw an object border

I have used only openCV and matplotlib.pyplot in most of the algorithms and numpy in some. I have also provided the outputs of most of the problems. Please feel free to commit changes and let me know your ideas.
